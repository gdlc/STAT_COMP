Run the code of Example 2 of the [Multiple Testing Handout](https://github.com/gdlc/STAT_COMP/blob/master/HANDOUTS/MultipleTesting.pdf)

Using the results generated by the example, compute the False-discovery proportion (FDP), and the proportion of Ha's that were discovered for each of the  following decision rules:

  - Reject if Bonferroni-adjusted pvalues< 0.05 
  - Reject if Holm's-adjusted pvalues< 0.05
  - Reject if FDR-adjusted pvalues<  0.05


See handout for details.
