### IN-CLASS 15: MVN Distribution

Create a function, named `rMVN(COV,mu,n)` that will simulate n IID samples from MVN(mu,COV).

The computations needed to sample from MVN distributions are described in section 12 of the the sampling random variables [handout](https://github.com/gdlc/STAT_COMP/blob/master/HANDOUTS/SimulatingRandomVariables.pdf).
