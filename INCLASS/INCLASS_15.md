### IN-CLASS 15: MVN Distribution

Create a function, named `rMVN(mu,COV,n)` that will simulate n IID samples from MVN(mu,COV), where `mu` is the mean vector, `COV` is the covariance matrix and `n` is the number of samples.

The computations required for sampling from MVN distributions are detailed in section 12 of the [handout](https://github.com/gdlc/STAT_COMP/blob/master/HANDOUTS/SimulatingRandomVariables.pdf) on sampling random variables. Additional hints can be found [here](https://github.com/gdlc/STAT_COMP/blob/master/HANDOUTS/MVNORM.md).

## Submission to Gradescope

For your submission to grade scope provide an R-script named `assignment.R` (match case) answering the questions shown below. If you have multiple files to submit, at least one of them is named as `assignment.R`.  You may submit your answer to Gradescope as many times as needed.

Include in your script the definition of the functions `rMVN(COV,mu,n)`, we will test them by sampling using a similar algorithm.
