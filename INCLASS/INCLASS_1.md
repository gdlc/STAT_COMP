**In-class assignment 1 - due on Tuesday 29th at 11:59pm on D2L**


**1)** Create within the R-environment these two vectors

       x=[1L,2L,3L]

and

        y=[1,2,3]
   
What class are x and y? Both of them are numeric vectors, what is the difference between them in their types?

 
 **2)** Multiply x and y using `x*y`, what are the dimensions and type of the resulting vector? 
 
 **3)** Add names to x ['x1','x2','x3'], and, using indexing by name, replace the second entry of x with the value 1.1. What is the type of x after the replacement? 
 
 **4)** Create a matrix (W) using `cbind(x,y)`. What is the class of W?
       
 **5)** Apply the log() function to the W matrix created in (4). Evaluate the dimensions and type of W. What do you learn about the way functions, which mathematically take a scalar as input, behave when applied to vectors and matrices?


## Submission to Gradescope

For your submission to grade scope provide an R-script named `assignment.R` (match case) answering the questions shown below. If you have multiple files to submit, at least one of them is named as `assignment.R`.  You may submit your answer to Gradescope as many times as needed.


  - Question 1: include two variables, named `Q1.1` and `Q1.2`  each storing the class of `x` and `y`, respectivesly.
  - Question 2: Store in a variable `Q2` the length of the product `x*y`
  - Question 3: Store in a variable named `Q3` the class of `x` after the replacement.
  - Question 4: Store the class of `W` in a variable named `Q4`.
