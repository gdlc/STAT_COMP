Provide an script and the output for the following problems

**1)** Create within the R-environment these two vectors

       x=[1L,2L,3L]

and

        y=[1,2,3]
   
 What are the types of x and y?
 
 
 **2)** Multiply x and y, what are the dimensions and type of the resulting vector?
 
 **3)** Add names to x ['x1','x2','x3'], and, using indexing by name, replace the second entry of x with the value 1.1. What is the type of x after the replacement?
 
 
 **4)** Create a matrix (W) using `cbind(x,y)`. What is the class of W?
       
 **5)** Apply the log() function to the W matrix created in (4)
 
 What do yo conclude about the behavior of functions that take scalar arguments when we apply them to arrays?
       
 **6)** Pick your two favorite cars and for each define the brand, model, year, and engine size. 
   - Create a list (length 2, one entry by car), each element of the list will contain the brand, model and year. Access to the information of the 1st and 2nd entry of the list using integer-indexing, and using `$`. Hint: see this [example](https://github.com/gdlc/STAT_COMP/blob/master/HANDOUTS/RIntro.md#lists).
   - Replace the 2nd entry of the list CARS with your first pick, and add a third entry to the list with your 2nd pick.
   - In a loop (from 1:3) print each element of the list.
